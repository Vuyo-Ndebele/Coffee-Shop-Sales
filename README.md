# Coffee Shop Sales

ðŸ“Š **Introduction**

- Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio focused on Coffee Shop Sales Analysis. This project showcases my ability to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can help drive business decisions.

- Using a dataset from a fictional (or real) coffee shop, I examine key performance indicators such as product popularity, peak sales hours, customer behavior, and revenue trends. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and opportunities that can support better inventory planning, marketing strategies, and overall business growth.
