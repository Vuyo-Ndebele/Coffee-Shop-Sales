## üìä Introduction

1. Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio focused on Coffee Shop Sales Analysis. This project showcases my ability to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can help drive business decisions.

2. Using a dataset from a fictional coffee shop, I examined key performance indicators such as product popularity, peak sales hours, customer behavior, and revenue trends. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and opportunities that can support better inventory planning, marketing strategies, and overall business growth.

**_Disclaimer_** : _All the coffee shop dataset and reports do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of SQL and Microsoft Excel._

## ‚òï Problem Statement

1. A local coffee shop has been collecting sales data but has not fully utilized it to understand customer behavior, sales trends, or product performance. The management lacks clear insights into which products are most profitable, what times of day generate the most sales, and how customer preferences vary over time.

Without a data-driven approach, the shop struggles with challenges such as:

- Inefficient inventory planning

- Missed revenue opportunities during peak hours

- Limited understanding of customer purchase patterns

- Inability to tailor marketing strategies to high-performing products or periods

This project aims to analyze the coffee shop‚Äôs sales data to identify:

- Which products generate the most revenue? 

- Peak hours and days for sales activity

- Customer purchasing trends

- Sales trends across products and time intervals

- Opportunities for improving operational efficiency and 

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Used

SQL

- Wrote complex queries to extract and filter data from sales table

- Performed aggregations to calculate total revenue, average sales, and product performance

- Used GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CASE WHEN, CTEs, and subqueries for in-depth analysis

- Identified trends in sales by time of day, day of the week, and product category

Excel

- Created pivot tables to summarize key metrics like sales per product and revenue per day

- Built dynamic dashboards using charts and slicers to visualize performance trends

- Business intelligence storytelling using dashboards and reports

## üìÇ Data Sourcing

The dataset used for this analysis represents point-of-sale transactions from a coffee shop over a given time period. It includes fields such as:

- Transaction Date and Time

- Product Names and Categories

- Quantity Sold

- Unit Price and Total Sale Amount

- Payment Method

- Customer Type

## üîÑ Data Transformation

To prepare the coffee shop sales data for analysis, several transformation steps were carried out using SQL. 
These steps ensured the data was clean, structured, and ready for meaningful insights.

## In SQL:

- Removed duplicates and handled missing or inconsistent entries

- Formatted date and time columns for time-based analysis (e.g., extracting day, month, hour)

- Created  bucket list column such as transaction time

- Standardized categorical values

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The analysis of the coffee shop‚Äôs sales data revealed key insights into product performance, customer behavior, and sales trends. Most sales occurred during morning and early afternoon hours, with certain products like lattes and cappuccinos consistently leading in popularity. Additionally, repeat customers contributed significantly to overall revenue, highlighting the importance of customer retention.

Through data transformation and analysis in **SQL,** we were able to:

- Identify top-performing and underperforming products

- Pinpoint peak sales hours and high-traffic days

- Understand payment preferences and customer types

- Highlight opportunities to improve stock planning and promotions

## üìå Recommendations

**1. Focus on High-Selling Products**
Increase inventory and marketing efforts for top-performing items, especially during peak hours.

**2. Target Promotions During Off-Peak Hours**
Offer time-based discounts or loyalty rewards to boost sales during slower periods (e.g., late afternoons).

**3. Enhance Customer Retention Strategies**
Develop loyalty programs or personalized offers for returning customers, who form a major revenue base.

**4. Optimize Staff Scheduling**
Align staff shifts with peak periods to ensure fast service and maximize customer satisfaction.

**5. Use Data Continuously**
Establish a routine for collecting and analyzing sales data weekly or monthly to track trends and adjust business strategies in real time.
